Keane Ideas:
Sergio Ramos too many goals (N)
Two leg knockout not printing final score accurately - only spits out (Y)
Add group name above table when output tables (Y)
Nerf NZ? (N)
One leg game output result after full time wrong way round? (No idea)
Add head to head record to sort groups
Add loop and add results to data frame to please Samuel
Remove result after full time - seems uneccessary - has errors when ET occurs
Ensure only 2 UEFA in each group and no more than one of any other confederation
