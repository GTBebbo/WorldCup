# WorldCup ReadMe

# Welcome to the Python World Cup made by samwcounsell and githubkeano.

# This programme uses a binomial simulation to predict the outcome of the World Cup Qualifiers and tournament. 
# Every nations ratings and squads are our choices, so expect some weird outcomes, we don't know as much as we wish we did...

# We hope you enjoy a relatively realistic run through of the 2022 World Cup

# Instructions:

#1.0 The World Cup: Run the World_Cup_Simulation file, when asked if this is a test we reccomend N the first time, and Y afterwards (this allows skipping most of the qualifiers. For the qualifiers we reccomend setting the time delay to 0, otherwise the simulation will take quite a while.
  
 #2.0 The Dash App: After running the World Cup, run the Dash_App file in the other folder, you should see your three custom csv's that have saved and you will be able to use this app to do a deep dive into the intricacies of your personal simulation.

# Known Issues:
  # UEFA qualifying uses the nations league, this has not been added yet so we use a second round of group stages to select the final two teams to qualify from UEFA.
  
# Please let us know of any more issues you find, we really appreciate any feedback.
