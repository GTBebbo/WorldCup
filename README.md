# WorldCup ReadMe

# Welcome to the Python World Cup made by samwcounsell and githubkeano.

# This programme uses a binomial simulation to predict the outcome of the World Cup Qualifiers and tournament. 
# Every nations ratings and squads are our choices, so expect some weird outcomes, we don't know as much as we wish we did...

# We hope you enjoy a relatively realistic run through of the 2022 World Cup

# Known Issues:
  # Although there are multuiple host options, only Japan has fleshed out stadiums and cities, so whatever the host nation it states all games will be played in Japanese cities and Japanese stadiums.
