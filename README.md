# WorldCup ReadMe

# Welcome to the Python World Cup made by samwcounsell and githubkeano.

# This programme uses a binomial simulation to predict the outcome of the World Cup Qualifiers and tournament. 
# Every nations ratings and squads are our choices, so expect some weird outcomes, we don't know as much as we wish we did...

# We hope you enjoy a relatively realistic run through of the 2022 World Cup

# Known Issues:
  # UEFA qualifying uses the nations league, this has not been added yet so we use a second round of group stages to select the final two teams to qualify from UEFA.
  
# Please let us know of any more issues you find, we really appreciate any feedback.
